For installing mongodb, you can use home-brew and the following instructions:

Install brew:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew update
brew install mongodb-community@6.0

Now we can use brew to run mongodb:
brew services start mongodb-community@6.0

To stop the mongod server:
brew services stop mongodb-community@6.0
