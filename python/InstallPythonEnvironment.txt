List of steps for setup with Python 3.8 (for compatibility with Turi) (used Rosetta terminal, see here: “Open Finder and go to "Applications", then "Utilities". Make a copy of Terminal or iTerm2, whichever is your preference. Call your copy something like "Rosetta Terminal". Right click on it and select "Get Info". Click the checkbox which says "Open using Rosetta". Launch your Rosetta Terminal and install TuriCreate like you normally would.”


FOR AN M1/M2 Mac!!! you might need to:
1. Install using a terminal that is running x86 (i386) using rosetta:

2. Instead of running the first command below, you might need to run the following from the Rosetta terminals follows:
CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create "turi-env" python=3.8

If you are not sure which instruction set the terminal is using, try the "arch" command. If you get back arm64, this is M1/M2 instruction set (will not work for Turi). If you get back "i386" or "x86_64" this is using the instruction set needed for Turi.

Instructions for non-M1/M2 Macs:

conda create -n "turi-env" python=3.8

Instructions for all Macs: 
Note that numpy must be an older version to be compatible with Turi ...

conda activate python38env
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip 
pip3 install numpy==1.23.1  
pip3 install pandas 
pip3 install matplotlib  
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install seaborn 
pip3 install jupyter 
pip3 install coremltools
pip3 install turicreate
pip3 install pymongo
